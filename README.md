# Airbnb Data Analysis (Excel + Tableau)

## Overview
This project analyzes Airbnb listings data to uncover insights such as pricing trends, revenue patterns, and location-based performance.  
The data was downloaded from Kaggle, cleaned in Excel, and visualized in Tableau.

## Steps Performed
1. **Data Cleaning (Excel)**  
   - Removed duplicates and missing values.  
   - Standardized column formats.  
   - Created calculated columns where needed.  

2. **Data Modeling**  
   - Used foreign keys to perform **inner joins**.  

3. **Tableau Visualizations**  
   - **Price per Zipcode (Map)**  
   - **Average Price per Bedroom (Bar Chart)**  
   - **Revenue by Year (Line Chart)**  
   - **Price Distribution by Zipcode (Bar)**
   - **Distinct count of bedroom Listing**
